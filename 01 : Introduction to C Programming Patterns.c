// Concept of patterns in programming
// Importance of patterns, their applications, and how they can enhance problem-solving skills. 
// Pre-requisites : Basic C Programming, Data types, If else conditions, For loop, etc
// 100k coding challenge (5 parts) / 3 Hour Coding full
// Patterns help us solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components.
// They provide structure, organization, and efficiency to our code. By learning patterns, you'll develop problem-solving skills that are essential for any programmer.
// To follow along with this series, you'll need a C development environment. There are various options available, such as IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or text editors like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code. Choose the one that suits your preferences and set it up on your machine.
